## Functions

    > f <- function(arg1, arg2){
    > 
    > }

* Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
* Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside of another function
* The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.

You can mix positional matching with matching by name. When an argument is matched by name, it is “taken out” of the argument list and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order
that they are listed in the function definition.
